# Mobile

Interclip mobile <sup>BETA</sup> is a mobile companion for the Interclip web app. It has most of the features of Interclip itself, so it can be used standalone.

## Instalation
The Interclip mobile app can be downloaded on both iOS and Android. If you are on Android and prefer sideloading, you can download the latest app bundle from [GitHub](https://github.com/filiptronicek/iclip-mobile/releases/latest/download/iclip.aab).

If you are on iOS, and would like to join our beta program, you can join [Interclip's Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/g9WUiQpm).
