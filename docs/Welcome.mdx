# Welcome
Welcome to the Interclip documentation!

## What is Interclip
Interclip is a modern solution for sharing URLs and files with yourself or anyone else. You probably share URLs by just emailing them to yourself, right? Think about it. Isn’t taht a bit... silly? Filling your inbox and taking so much time is just nonsense. If you use Interclip, you can just paste a URL and get back a five-digit randomly generated code. This code you can then input on your other device (doesn’t even have to be yours) and get the URL back.

## Awesome, where can I find it?
You can either go to our [Web App](https://interclip.app) or use any of our many [Client Apps](/Guides/Clients).
