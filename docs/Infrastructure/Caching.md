Interclip uses Redis to cache key components of the app so they run as smoothly as possible.

> Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory keyâ€“value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability.

### Why Redis?
- It's fast (the whole database is in RAM)
- It's simple (although highly customisable, Redis is quite simple to understand and operate)

### What is Redis used for?
In Interclip, we use Redis for the two following tasks:

#### Storing clips
When a new clip is created, it is added as a key in Redis with a <abbr title="Time To Live">TTL</abbr> of 7 days, so if it accessed again within that time period, it is served from the cache, instead of the database.

#### Rate limiting
Redis keeps tab on the number of hits per IP (hashed IP, to be specific) and only stores the data for 30 seconds after the last request.
