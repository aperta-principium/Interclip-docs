# Hall of shame

I, Filip, have made many mistakes in the code and docs of this project. Here are the funniest ones:
* I exposed the .env file so that anyone can view it right from their browser and see the database credentials (don't worry, AFAIK, no data has been stolen or deleted).
* I have made a typo in the spelling of the word "receive", spelling it as "receive". This wouldn't be so embarrassing by itself, but it was in the main menu for about a year and a half before I actually fixed it in https://github.com/aperta-principium/Interclip/commit/e96f1eb6a76295b13026ea48ee0acb9694f7d8b2
